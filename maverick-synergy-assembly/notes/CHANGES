Maverick Synergy 3.0.0-RC5 - April 6, 2021

Bug Fixes
    o FileLoggingContext fails with NPE when log path is relative.   
    o Authenticators setup in SshClientContext would incorrectly be attempted multiple times. 
    o ClientStateListener authenticate method no longer passes a List of Authenticator objects to be started after it returns. Authentication should be initiated within the authenticate handler.
    o Ensure that password authenticator future is triggered when wrapped with in automatic keyboard-interactive conversion.
    o Don't pass authenticator to PasswordOverKeyboardInteractiveCallback because there is no way for its future to be completed.
    o OpenSSH certificate extensions values and critical options not encoded correctly during sign operation. 
    o Fixed connection-based logging which was incorrectly preventing logging without an identification or user configured value.
    o Moved some VirtualFileFactory log statements to TRACE as they are even too chatty for DEBUG mode.
    o Callback role switching was broken for normal SSH clients due to changes made in TransportProtocol relating to posting of identification string.
    o Moved connection error TRACE statement to DEBUG
    o Callback mount URI should be passed to VFSFactory as base path.

****************************************************************************************************
IMPORTANT COMPATIBILITY INFORMATION

This release requires the use of maverick-common 2.0 which is included in this release. This is a 
new dependency that has been created to share a common base with the Maverick Legacy API to ensure
this API benefits from changes and new algorithms implemented in the production branch of the 
Maverick Legacy API.

This release is therefore not binary compatible with previous releases and you should expect to modify
your code accordingly with change in imports and minor interface changes.

--------------------

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

This is the first public release of the 1.6.x stable branch. Previous releases indicated below were 
internal releases only. Source code developed with versions 1.4.x or lower will not be binary compatible
with this API although changes should be minimal as this new branch is a continuation of the work of those 
branches and should be considered the stable successor to 1.4.x versions.

Please note that the internal cryptographic provider has been removed and as such all cryptographic
functions are provided by the installed Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) in your environment. The minimum
required version of Java is 1.5. 

SSHD Maverick 1.6.2 - Sept 5, 2013

Bug Fixes
    o Incoming swap byte[] is not dereferenced on socket close causing potential memory leak.   
    o Removed invalid check for null in SftpSubsystem RealPathOperation.
    o ConcurrentModificationException thrown during shutdownNow.

------------------

SSHD Maverick 1.6.1 - Jul 18, 2013

Bug Fixes
    o Subsystem operations moved to transport to allow other components to synchronize with cleanup correctly.
    o Cleanup was executed based on session identifier being a non-null value, however if key exchange had not completed, cleanup would not be performed. 
    o Authentication Failure event is not fired on the final attempt when authentication retry limit is reached.

------------------

SSHD Maverick 1.6.0 - June 19, 2013

Features
    o Logging is now provided though SLF4J.

    o SFTP threading is now controlled by an Executor providing the ability to configure maximum number of concurrent transfers or replace with your own implementation.
    o VirtualFileSystem can now be instantiated with mount objects removing the need for system wide configuration.
    o FileSystemFactory now controls creation of FileSystem instances.
    o Added Connection object for easy identification of individual sessions in events.
    
-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.44 - May 10, 2013

Features
    o Added SocketConnectionFactory interface to allow possible override of SocketConnection implementation on a per-connection basis.
    o Added SshContext.enableFIPSMode to configure the server to only use FIPS supported algorithms. This requires a JCE that supports 2048 bit DH primes so is incompatible with SunJCE, use BouncyCastle JCE to support this or a FIPS certified JCE.
    
Bug Fixes
    o Ensure selector is closed correctly at end of selector thread.
    o SocketForwardingChannel could potentially send data out of sequence if last message in queue was not written fully.
    
-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.43 - Mar 21, 2013

Features
    o Server can now start a listening interface with a port value of zero allowing the OS to select an open free port. Use ListeningInterface.getActualPort to retreive the allocated port number.
    
Bug Fixes
    o Remote forwarding request with zero port value allocates random unallocated port but fails to return correct value to client.
    o Remote forwarding request always returns port value in response causing incompatibility with some clients.
    o SCP client that fails to wait for acknowledgment of completed transfer causes premature channel close and termination of scp thread. Workaround added for this scenario to allow a transfer to be considered complete if server has received total file as reported by client.
    o SCP upload/download events were not fired for failed transfers.
    o ScpCommand.readFromRemote now captures base IOException and logs before re-throwing for error state clarity.
    o Server fails to put ciphers into use immediately after sending SSH_MSG_NEW_KEYS resulting in error if client SSH_MSG_NEW_KEYS is not received before an SSH_MSG_IGNORE is sent. 
    o License verification made less sensitive to whitespace changes.
    o Exception in ProtocolClientAcceptor.finishAccept could potentially leave a SelectionKey open.
    o Made synchronization in DataWindow consistently synchronize on the same object.
    o RemoteForwardingChannel window space and remote packet variables allocated incorrectly.
    o OpenSSHPublicKeyFile performs unnecessary check against key algorithm name preventing further supported types being used.
    o Forwarding channel does not send queued data before being closed when server is under load.
    o Channel.sendChannelDataWithBuffering is no longer useful as all channel data is buffered according to window space availability so method has been deprecated, use sendChannelData instead.

-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.42 - Dec 7, 2012

Features
    o Updated RemoteForwardingManager to support x11 channels. Requires an implementation (not provided) as x11 channels are not supported by default.
    
Bug Fixes
    o Added setLocale method to SshContext. This allows the default locale to be changed, currently only used to generate the long name format in SFTP file responses.
    o Authentication protocol should not send a completed authentication method in the list of methods that can continue in a partial authentication success message.
    o Possible race condition in new SftpSubsystem shutdown process causes SFTP connection to hang upon close.
    o Allow zero length file flag set to false can incorrectly delete a file that had previously existed if the client opened and closed without reading/writing from the file). 
    o onChannelClosed not called when channel is closed due to unexpected connection shutdown.
    o Possible deadlock scenario in Channel.close and ConnectionProtocol.stop and processQueuedData
    
-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.41 - Oct 24, 2012

Bug Fixes
    o SftpFile is now initialized with absolute path in readDirectory operations. This is for internal processing only, the filename sent to the client is still the name of the file relative to the directory as per specification.
    o Newly opened channel is closed incorrectly under load by the previous owner of the channel id calling close a second time. 
    o Failed transfer events at SFTP subsystem close now have open file handle SSHDEventCodes.ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE attribute.
    o A condition exists where a SocketForwardingChannel is able to send data out of sequence if last message in queue is not entirely sent on first attempt.
    o Maximum number of connections are tracked globally but each SshContext can have its own unique distinct setting. Connections are now tracked by context.
    o SFTP subsystem asynchronous operations thread could be ended prematurely causing transfer to end in error.
    o SocketForwardingChannel fails to request write operation after queuing data.
    
-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.40 - Sept 19, 2012

Features
    o Added restart method to Daemon. Optional 'graceful' restart option allows server to stop accepting connections but continue to service existing connections. After all connections have closed (or a forced maximum time limit) the restart is performed.
    o AES-128-CBC encryption now supported in OpenSSH private key files.    

Bug Fixes
    o Ensure SelectionKey.cancel is called in shutdown to prevent Windows JRE from keeping listening port open.

    o ConnectionManager use of sessionid is subject to system default character encoding allowing potential clashes resulting in incorrect number of connections reported.
    
-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.38 - June 28, 2012

Features
    o Flag added to SshContext to disallow zero length file upload.

-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.36 - May 1, 2012

Bug Fixes
    o Fixed issue with forwarding channels causing excessive CPU usage in some close scenarios.
    
-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.35 - Feb 8, 2012

Features
    o newline@vandyke.com SFTP extension added.
         
Bug Fixes

-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.34 - Sept 14, 2011
     
Bug Fixes
    o onChannelClose not called when connection is disconnected before remote SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE is received.
    o TransportProtocol selectNegotiatedComponent made more tolerant of spaces in algorithm strings.
    o Uninitialised GSSAPI module causes connection error, GSSAPI must be added explicitly if you want to support it. To do this add context.supportAuthenticationMechanisms().add("gssapi-with-mic", Class.forName("com.maverick.sshd.GSSAPIWithMICAuthentication")); in your Daemon.configure method.
    o Virtual File System path canonicalization causes file not found errors with symbolic links with targets outside of valid mount paths. Use system property -Dmaverick.alternativeCanonicalize=true to enable a change in behaviour that allows these to be resolved whilst still maintaining mount security.
         
-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.33 - June 3, 2011
   
Features                       
    o gssapi-with-mic authentication method added.
    o Added support for MD5 signatures in RSA certificates.
    
Bug Fixes
    o SFTP subsystem attempts to send exit code after channel is closed causing NullPointerException.
    o ExecutableCommand race condition causing data to potentially be sent prior to completion of 'exec' or 'shell' SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST_SUCCESS message.
    o Optional workaround added for JDK bug 4640544 that prevents NIO non-blocking socket from binding on windows. Set -Dmaverick.windowsIpv6Workaround=true to activate.
    o File transfers not completed at connection close do not have any failed transfer events fired. 
    o AuthenticationProvider translation of session id into string can potentially cause NativeAuthenticationProvider.logoffUser() call to be skipped due to duplicate session id strings. 
    
-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.32 - February 7, 2011

Features

    o Added support for x509v3-sign-dss public/private keys & certificates.
    
Bug Fixes
    o SFTP subsystem formats UID/GID integer values in ls -l operation. Added methods to SftpFileAttributes so that username/group strings can be added, many clients will show these instead of the UID.GID values when listing directories.
    o x509v3-sign-rsa made compatible with older version of specification.
    o Bad SSH client can cause OOM in SFTP operation by sending large number of read requests without releasing window space for the server to return the data requested. Default behavior of SftpSubsystem has subsequently been changed to require an asynchronous operation thread to ensure that reads are not performed before window space on the client is available. It is recommended that all users keep the default behavior and remove any calls to SshContext.setAsynchronousFileOperations
    o EVENT_SFTP_DOWNLOAD_COMPLETED in some circumstances may not have been triggered.
    o NativeFileSystemProvider.closeFilesystem does not get called in some scenarios.

    o SCP get operation fails to reset session state, causing download failures if transfer takes longer than session timeout period.
    o Session channel sends SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE on command/session execution failure before sending SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE causing a potential deadlock scenario with J2SSH Maverick.

-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.4.30 - July 14, 2010

Bug Fixes
    o  Discovered race condition in transport protocol state when client sends SSH identification string and key exchange initialization packet before waiting for the server's SSH identification string.

    o Channel close synchronization causes deadlock when another thread attempts to issue window
      space after posting data.
    o Added check to ensure no queued data exists before closing channel.
    o Added null check on session when initialization fails; NullPointerException could be thrown 
      if client disconnects prior to initialization completing. 
    o Formatted attributes sent in SFTP protocol uses 12hr instead of 24hr time format.  
    o VirtualFileSystem StackOverflowError after invalid path is received from client. 
    o Added Option for NativeFileSystemProvider to return -1 rather than throw EOFException to indicate
      end-of-file in file reads. 
    o Changed SftpSubsystem asynchronous operation thread to notify waiting threads with notifyAll
      instead of notify
    o VirtualFileSystem now attempts to force remaining writes to disk before closing file.

	o  Daemon: changed so that getLicense and getVersion methods appear in source to allow testing
	o  ProtocolEngine: Added disconnect() method.
	o  RemoteForwardingFactoryImpl: changed bindInterface() so that the backlog of the socket created is acquired from the 
	    com.maverick.sshd.SshContext.getMaximumSocketsBacklogPerRemotelyForwardedConnection() method.
	o  SelectorThread.closeAllChannels: Now disconnects the protocol engine.
	o  SshContext: new init() method added that sets the daemon instance, and new zero argument constructor added so that an SshContext instance can be created and configured before attaching a daemon to it.
	o  SshContext: added setRequiredAuthenticationMethods convenience method to set the authentication methods required by the server, options are PUBLIC_KEY, PASSWORD, PUBLIC_KEYandPASSWORD, ANY:
	o  SshContext: added getMaximumSocketsBacklogPerRemotelyForwardedConnection() and setMaximumSocketsBacklogPerRemotelyForwardedConnection() methods 
	    to com.maverick.sshd.SshContext.
	o  VirtualFileSystem: added closeFile(byte[] handle,boolean remove) method to com.maverick.sshd.vfs.VirtualFileSystem.java that allows a file to be closed but not removed from the list of open files, and changed closeFilesystem so that it closes files but does not remove them, to allow custom code to perform actions on closed files such as transfer them to a different location.
	o  multiple protocols can now be added to the server instead of being fixed to SSHD.
	o  DaemonContext and SshContext: have replaced ConfigurationContext
	o  Daemon: replaces SshDaemon
	o  SocketForwardingChannel: This now extends ForwardingChannel, most of ForwardingChannel's functionality is now in SocketForwardingChannel

	    by abstracting com.maverick.sshd.RemoteForwardingManager and changing it to extend com.maverick.nio.ForwardingManager.java.  
	    com.maverick.nio.ForwardingManager.java now manages forwarding, has the getInstance method, and has a clearinstances() method 
	    which removes any registered forwardingmanagers.
	o  DaemonContext: getListeningInterfaces() now returns all the bound interfaces rather than all the interfaces that Daemon tried to bind to.  
	o  RemoteForwardingManager: Memory leak fixed in com.maverick.sshd.RemoteForwardingManager.unregisterConnection

SSHD Maverick 1.3.4 - May 15, 2008
	
Features
	o  AbstractComponentFactory: Recoded  so that algorithm lists can be fully ordered, there is now a new changePositionofAlgorithm  method which facilitates this. 	
	o  ConfigurationContext: Added addEventListener and removeEventListener methods for use with the new logging event model.
	o  ConfigurationContext: Changed setAuthenticationProvider to accept an instance of AuthenticationProvider rather than an AuthenticationProvider class
	o  ConnectionProtocol: Added workaround to the stop() method for clients that send disconnect before channelclose to ensure that channels are cleaned.
	o  ServerComponentManager: Recoded ServerComponentManager,SshContext so that ciphers and macs can have independent preferences for Server->Client and Client->Server communications.
	o  ServerComponentManager: com.maverick.sshd.components.ServerComponentManager.java now tries JCE first if the com.maverick.sshd.components.ServerComponentManager.tryStandaloneCryptographyBeforeJCE is set to false otherwise Standalone is tried first, this allows the choice to use JCE or Standalone cryptography to be made programatically instead of by changing the classpath or creating a class loader.
	o  SessionChannel: added setMaxWindowSpace(int minSizeMultiple) method which allows the MAX_WINDOW_SPACE to be set to a multiple of MIN_WINDOW_SPACE.
	o  SshDaemon: added new method  com.maverick.sshd.SshDaemon.loadOrGenerateHostKey(File, String, int, ConfigurationContext, int, int, String) that allows the servers host key to be passphrase protected
	o  VirtualFileSystem: now logs an error if the vfs root path is not a directory or does not exist
	o  Added AES192CBC and AES256CBC ciphers.
	o  Removed DiffieHellmanGroup14Sha1 until better code safety can be added when JCES are used that do not support it.
	o  All logging has been changed to use an event model.  Important events have their own event codes, 
		less important events are wrapped using EventLog and use the "log event" code or the "debug" event code.
	o  TransportProtocol: Added getLocalPort, getLocalAddress and getPort methods.
	
Bug Fixes
	o  Channel: removed parameter from Channel.evaluateWindowSpace as it was not used in SessionChannel.

	o  AuthenticationProvider: Added logon method that takes the clients public key as a parameter
	o  AuthenticationProviderChanged logon(byte[], String, SocketAddress, SshPublicKey) to 
		logon(byte[], String, SocketAddress, SshPublicKey, boolean).  
		If the new parameter is true then if provider.logonUser returns true, the pendingUser is not added to the list of current users.
	o  AuthenticationProvider: Added getAuthenticationStatus() method to  
	    to allow authentications to set an SshAuthenticationStatus variable when a simple boolean successful is inadequate.
	o  ConfigurationContext: Added setFileSystemProvider_KeyStore() method to allow the NFS for the KeyStore to be different from that passed to setFileSystemProvider().
	o  NativeAuthenticationProvider: Changed logonUser(byte[], String, SocketAddress, SshPublicKey) to 
		logonUser(byte[], String, SocketAddress, SshPublicKey, boolean).  
		The new parameter indicates whether the client is checking whether their key is acceptable 
		or they are attempting to logon.
	o  NativeAuthenticationProvider: Added getAuthenticationStatus() method to allow authentications 
	    to set an SshAuthenticationStatus variable when a simple boolean succesful is inadequate.

Bug Fixes
	o  TransportProtocol.internalDisconnect() now doesn't fail if the AuthenticationProvider is not set.
	o  AuthenticationProvider.getHomeDirectory() now throws an IOException if the users home directory does not exist.
	o  Changed com.maverick.ssh.components.AbstractComponentFactory.createDelimitedList(String preferred, Enumeration names) 
	    so that if the preferred component is not contained within the enumeration, it is not prepended to the list.

-----------------
SSHD Maverick 1.3.2 - August 13, 2007
Features
     o  Changed com.maverick.sshd.vfs.VirtualFileSystem: slight code optimisations

Bug Fixes

-----------------
SSHD Maverick 1.3.1 - May 8, 2007

Bug Fixes
     o  CancelledKeyException can cause transfer thread to exit, causing hanging state
        for connected clients.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: 

This version of Maverick SSHD may not be compatible with source code developed using previous 
versions of the API. Changes have been required to some package structures to enable the 
cryptographic provider to be completely seperated from the API. These changes now allow us
to provide seperate implementations of the API for the internal cryptographic provider and 
the Java Cryptography Extensions provider. 

SSHD Maverick 1.3.0 - February 12, 2007

Features
    o  API can now be used exclusivley with the Java Runtime JCE provider, or alternativley
       the internal provider. Simply select the maverick-sshd-jce-only.jar file if you want to use
       the JCE exclusivley, or maverick-sshd-standalone-only.jar if you want to use the internal
       provider. The maverick-sshd.jar contains all implementations and will default to the
       internal provider. 

Bug Fixes

	o  AuthorizedKeysStoreImpl.java now passes the attributes of the authorizedKeysFile to nfs.openFile() instead of passing an empty set of attributes.

-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.2.14 - November 28, 2006

Features
    o  SshDaemon startup method additional option to shutdown if any interface fails to bind. 
    o  Added option to clear a ConfigurationContext component factory.

Bug Fixes
    o  VFSPermissonHandler interface does not provide getPermissions method with username parameter
    o  Shutdown method throws NullPointerException if server is not started correctly.
    o  Shutdown method ensures all threads are exited before returning.

-----------------

    o  Non ascii characters in folder name causes "The handle is invalid" error.
    o  Canonicalization of paths may cause double // in path in log files.
    o  File system last modified date is out of bounds on rare occasions causing
       fatal errors when listing folders which contain these files. Check added to 
       prevent fatal error.

-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.2.12 - August 8, 2006

Features
    o  Added diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 key exchange as per SSH Transport Protocol specification. This 
       implementation exists in both the internal crypto provider and JCE formats although it should be
       noted that the default SUN reference JCE provider does not support 2048 bit primes required by
       this key exchange method. The BouncyCastle JCE provider (www.bouncycastle.org) does and has been
       used to test this algorithm works with JCE enabled.

Bug Fixes
    o  Added system property "filezilla.bug.workaround" to help workaround an issue with Filezilla

       performance and removes the high CPU usage problem and removes a the third party dependency.
    o  Rewritten threading model to better distribute the load between available threads. An additional
       option is now provided to enable the maximum number of selectors per thread to be set. 
    o  Thread settings can now be set using the ConfigurationContext.

-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.0.3 - July 20, 2004

Bug Fixes
    o  Shutdown method not available in SshDaemon causing possible net bind errors. A Runtime hook
       has been added to call this method when the VM exits but it is recommended that implementations
       provide a more reliable method of calling the method when the server requires to be shutdown.

-----------------

SSHD Maverick 1.0.2 - July 18, 2004

Bug Fixes
    o  Incorrect state caused identification string to be sent as a binary packet 
       (this caused client to hang or disconnect in error)
    o  SSH_FXP_REAL_PATH message changed to send absolute path in both filename and longname fields
       (this is not exactly how version 3 of the protocol describes but other client and 
       servers have adopted this method and therefore our implementation could cause a problem)
    o  SSH_FXP_STATUS message failed to include language field
